			<h1>About the Seattle Housing Map</h1>
			<p>
				This interactive web GIS application helps users explore spatial factors that influence housing decisions near 
				the University of Washington and surrounding Seattle neighborhoods. The map integrates multiple data layers to 
				provide a clearer picture of neighborhoods surrounding UW. Users can interact with filters, pop-ups, and sidebar 
				visualizations to make informed housing decisions
			</p>

			<h2>Project Goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide an interactive tool for understanding housing-related conditions near UW.</li>
				<li>Visualize metrics such as rent prices, crime density, and transit proximity.</li>
				<li>Enable users to compare neighborhoods using filters and map layers.</li>
				<li>Support informed decision-making for students and young professionals considering different options in the Greater-Seattle Area.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data Sources</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::apartment-market-rent-prices-by-census-tract/explore?location=53.650757%2C-113.327157%2C11.52" target="_blank">Apartment Market Rent Price Categories</a></li> 
				<ul>
     				 <li>The data presented on the map for Price Range is sourced from Seattle Geodata. It is just one column of a very detailed summary from 2001-2025 that 
						shows year-to-year rent changes per square foot/unit, among other metrics. If you are interested in learning more, please check out the linked census tract.
					 </li>
				</ul>
				<li>Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) Zones</li>
				<li>Seattle Police Department Crime Data</li>
				<li>Seattle Transit and Stops (Light Rail, Bus)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Design</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Dataset filtering tools to toggle different data layers</li>
				<li>Pop-up map features that display detailed information</li>
				<li>Crime Clusters</li>
				<li>MHA Zones</li>
				<li>Route line display from light rail stations to key locations (e.g., UW)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Important Notes</h2>
			<p>
				Please note that crime data reflects reported incidents over the last year.
				Not all incidents are reported, and patterns may be influenced by policing practices,
				neighborhood demographics, and other systemic factors. The visualization assumes that users have 
				prior knowledge of how individual bus stops connect into routes and how service operates beyond stop locations.
