			<h1>About the Seattle Housing Map</h1>
			<p>
				This interactive web GIS application helps users explore affordable housing options near the University
				of Washington and surrounding Seattle neighborhoods. The map combines multiple data layers to visualize 
				housing affordability, rent prices, neighborhood safety, and transit accessibility. Users can interact 
				with the map using filters, pop-ups, and sidebar charts to make informed housing decisions.
			</p>

			<h2>Project Goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide an interactive tool for exploring housing affordability near UW and Seattle.</li>
				<li>Visualize key metrics such as rent prices, crime density, and transit proximity.</li>
				<li>Allow users to filter neighborhoods by price, safety, and accessibility.</li>
				<li>Encourage informed decision-making for students and young professionals looking for housing in the Greater-Seattle Area.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data Sources</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Apartment Market Rent Price Categories</li>
				<li>Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) Zones</li>
				<li>Seattle Police Department Crime Data</li>
				<li>Seattle Transit Stops</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Important Notes</h2>
			<p>
				Please note that crime data reflects reported incidents over the last five years.
				Not all incidents are reported, and patterns may be influenced by policing practices,
				neighborhood demographics, and other systemic factors.
